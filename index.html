    <p>TWIDTWIDAIFOHS is an 8-bit, first person RPG. Your player wakes up at
        the edge of the pier with no memory of the past and no knowledge of 
        the present, and must quickly grapple with his new surroundings. Various
        items are scattered throughout the map, but you can only carry what will
        fit in the pockets of your overalls. Some of the items have multiple 
        uses, and others may be combined. You will encounter a handful of other
        characters, who are as likely to become enemies as they are allies. The
        ultimate goal of the game is understanding and acceptance, which may be
        achieved by drawing conclusions from clues found, forming relationships
        with people met, and taking positive risks. This is reflected on your inner-peace-ometer. </p>
